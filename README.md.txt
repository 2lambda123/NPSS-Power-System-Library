This repository contains a power system library for NPSS, containing
circuit components such as resistors and capacitors, electric machines,
and ports that are used to link them together. The library also includes
bus components that allow more than two elements to be connected to a
single node. Several examples are included in the library to demonstrate
the use of the various components, and how they may be connected to an
NPSS gas-turbine engine model.
